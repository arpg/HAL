This driver is for Occam Vision Group's omni60 camera, both mono (tested) and color (untested)

To download the SDK from Occam, one must first register to get access to the link.
This driver expects to find indigo.h in /usr/include/occam, and tries to find libindigo.so in /usr/lib
This driver is written against Occam SDK version 2.0.13


Currently, this driver supports opening a camera by serial number as well as the default of opening the first enumerated camera.

The camera exports a PbBuf of size 5, with the raw, unprocessed images
